# Machine Learning Internship Project at Codveda Technologies

This repository contains the tasks completed as part of a machine learning internship. The goal is to demonstrate understanding and implementation of various machine learning techniques on different datasets, including regression, classification, and clustering.

## Dataset
**Note**: Datasets were provided for internship purposes and are not included in this repository.
- For Task 1, the dataset used is a **House Prediction dataset** containing numerical features to predict house prices.

## Completed Tasks
Here are the 6 tasks included in this repository:

### **Task 1: Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning**
- Added feature names to the dataset.
- Separated input features (X) and target variable (y).
- Handled missing data by checking for null values (none were found).
- Verified that all features are numeric; no encoding required.
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
- Verified correctness of standardization (mean ≈ 0, std = 1).
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn  
- **Notebook:** `Task1/Task1_Level1.ipynb`
